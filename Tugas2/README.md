# DB API Development Source Code
The REST API serves as an online bookstore for the updated GRB database, with refactored code.
Designed for the Good Reading Bookstore, the application organizes code into distinct files:
- queries.js: Manages PostgreSQL database queries.
- routes.js: Handles endpoint routes.
- controller.js: Implements API business logic.
- db.js: Manages Pool connection to PostgreSQL, with database credentials stored in the .env file.
- server.js: Provides access to the backend.
